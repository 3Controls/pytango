Welcome to PyTango |version| documentation!
===========================================

PyTango is a python module that exposes to Python_ the complete Tango_ C++ API
(including both client and server).

This means that you can write not only tango applications (scripts, CLIs, GUIs) 
that access tango device servers but also tango device servers themselves, all 
of this in pure python.
